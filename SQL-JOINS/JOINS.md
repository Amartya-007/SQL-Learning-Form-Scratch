# SQL Joins Explained in Detail

## 1. Introduction to SQL Joins

In SQL, Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Understanding joins is crucial for querying and analyzing data efficiently, and is a common topic in SQL interviews.

### Why Use Joins?

- **Data Relationships:** Tables are often related, such as employees and departments, and joins help in retrieving comprehensive information.
- **Efficient Data Retrieval:** Joins streamline the process of querying data across multiple tables.
- **Comprehensive Reports:** Joins enable detailed and insightful reports by combining data from different sources.

## 2. Setting Up the Tables

To demonstrate SQL Joins, we will use two tables: `EMPLOYEES` and `DEPARTMENTS`.

### 2.1 `EMPLOYEES` Table

This table stores employee details. If you don’t have this table, you can create it using the following commands:

```sql
-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS SampleDB;

-- Use the database
USE SampleDB;

-- Create the table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    Department VARCHAR(50),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    JoinDate DATE
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary, JoinDate) VALUES
(1, 'John', 'Doe', 'HR', 50000.00, '2020-01-15'),
(2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'IT', 60000.00, '2019-03-10'),
(3, 'Michael', 'Johnson', 'Finance', 75000.00, '2021-07-22'),
(4, 'Emily', 'Davis', 'IT', 65000.00, '2022-11-11'),
(5, 'James', 'Brown', 'HR', 45000.00, '2018-05-30'),
(6, 'Robert', 'Wilson', 'Marketing', 55000.00, '2023-04-18'),
(7, 'Sarah', 'Taylor', 'HR', 62000.00, '2020-08-15'),
(8, 'David', 'Anderson', 'Finance', 54000.00, '2023-01-20'),
(9, 'Laura', 'Martinez', 'IT', 58000.00, '2021-02-12'),
(10, 'Emily', 'Clark', 'Sales', 47000.00, '2019-11-05'),
(11, 'Anna', 'Lee', 'Support', 49000.00, '2022-03-18'),
(12, 'Paul', 'Walker', 'Marketing', 51000.00, '2021-08-24'),
(13, 'Nina', 'Scott', 'Legal', 72000.00, '2022-12-15'),
(14, 'Tom', 'Moore', 'Operations', 56000.00, '2023-02-01'),
(15, 'Olivia', 'Martin', 'Development', 65000.00, '2023-07-10');

```

### 2.2 `DEPARTMENTS` Table

This table stores department details. Use the following commands to create and populate it:

```sql
-- Create the table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS DEPARTMENTS (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50),
    Location VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO DEPARTMENTS (DepartmentID, DepartmentName, Location) VALUES
(1, 'HR', 'New York'),
(2, 'Finance', 'London'),
(3, 'IT', 'San Francisco'),
(4, 'Marketing', 'Chicago'),
(5, 'Sales', 'Boston'),
(6, 'Support', 'Seattle'),
(7, 'Legal', 'Houston'),
(8, 'Operations', 'Phoenix'),
(9, 'Development', 'Austin'),
(10, 'Research', 'Denver'),
(11, 'IT', 'San Jose'),
(12, 'HR', 'Los Angeles'),
(13, 'Finance', 'Paris'),
(14, 'Marketing', 'Dallas'),
(15, 'Sales', 'San Diego');
```

## 3. Understanding Different Types of Joins

### 3.1 INNER JOIN

**Definition:** An `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows where there is a match between the tables being joined. If there is no match, the row is not included in the result.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Departments.DepartmentName, Departments.Location
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Departments
ON Employees.Department = Departments.DepartmentName;
```

**Result:** This will show only the employees who are in departments that exist in the `DEPARTMENTS` table.

### 3.2 LEFT JOIN

**Definition:** A `LEFT JOIN` returns all the rows from the left table (`Employees`), and the matched rows from the right table (`Departments`). If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Departments.DepartmentName, Departments.Location
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN Departments
ON Employees.Department = Departments.DepartmentName;
```

**Result:** This will include all employees, even those without a matching department in the `DEPARTMENTS` table.

### 3.3 RIGHT JOIN

**Definition:** A `RIGHT JOIN` returns all the rows from the right table (`Departments`), and the matched rows from the left table (`Employees`). If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Departments.DepartmentName, Departments.Location
FROM Employees
RIGHT JOIN Departments
ON Employees.Department = Departments.DepartmentName;
```

**Result:** This will include all departments, even those without employees in the `Employees` table.

### 3.4 FULL JOIN

**Definition:** A `FULL JOIN` (or `FULL OUTER JOIN`) returns all rows when there is a match in either table. If there’s no match, NULL values are returned for the unmatched columns.

**Note:** MySQL does not support `FULL OUTER JOIN` directly. You can simulate it using a `UNION` of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Departments.DepartmentName, Departments.Location
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN Departments
ON Employees.Department = Departments.DepartmentName
UNION
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Departments.DepartmentName, Departments.Location
FROM Employees
RIGHT JOIN Departments
ON Employees.Department = Departments.DepartmentName;
```

**Result:** This combines

results from both `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`, showing all rows from both tables.

Certainly! Here’s the corrected and complete example for the `SELF JOIN`, including all necessary steps to set up the `ManagerID` column and update the `EMPLOYEES` table:

### 3.5 SELF JOIN

**Definition:** A `SELF JOIN` is a join where a table is joined with itself. This is useful to compare rows within the same table, such as finding relationships between employees and their managers within the same table.

**Steps:**

1. **Add the `ManagerID` Column:**

   First, add the `ManagerID` column to the `EMPLOYEES` table if it doesn't already exist:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE Employees
   ADD ManagerID INT;
   ```

2. **Update the `ManagerID` Column:**

   Populate the `ManagerID` column with appropriate values. For example, you can update it to reflect that some employees are managed by others:

   ```sql
   -- Assuming Jane Smith (EmployeeID = 2) is the manager of employees with IDs 4, 5, and 6
   UPDATE Employees
   SET ManagerID = 2
   WHERE EmployeeID IN (4, 5, 6);

   -- Assuming Michael Johnson (EmployeeID = 3) is the manager of employees with IDs 7, 8, and 9
   UPDATE Employees
   SET ManagerID = 3
   WHERE EmployeeID IN (7, 8, 9);
   ```

3. **Perform the `SELF JOIN`:**

   Now you can perform the `SELF JOIN` to list each employee alongside their manager’s name:

   ```sql
   SELECT e1.FirstName AS Employee, e2.FirstName AS Manager
   FROM Employees e1
   LEFT JOIN Employees e2
   ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID;
   ```

**Result:** This query will list each employee along with their manager’s name. Employees without managers will have `NULL` in the `Manager` column, and managers who are not managed by anyone will also be shown with `NULL` in the `Employee` column.

### 3.6 UNION

**Definition:** The `UNION` operator combines the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set. Each `SELECT` statement must have the same number of columns, and the columns must have compatible data types.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT FirstName AS Name FROM Employees
UNION
SELECT DepartmentName AS Name FROM Departments;
```

**Result:** This query combines names from both the `Employees` and `Departments` tables, eliminating duplicates. If a name appears in both tables, it will only appear once in the result.
