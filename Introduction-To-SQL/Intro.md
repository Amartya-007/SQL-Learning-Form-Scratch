### **1. Introduction to SQL**

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is the cornerstone of managing and interacting with relational databases. It’s a standardized language that allows users to perform various operations on the data stored in a database, such as querying, updating, and managing the database structure. SQL is essential for developers, data analysts, and database administrators who work with relational databases.

### **History of SQL**

#### **Origin and Development**

- **Early 1970s**: SQL was developed at IBM by Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin. Initially named **SEQUEL** (Structured English Query Language), it was designed to manipulate and retrieve data stored in IBM's first relational database, System R.
- **Renaming**: Due to trademark issues, SEQUEL was renamed **SQL**.
- **User-Friendly Syntax**: The language was designed with a syntax that is close to natural English, making it easier for users to learn and apply compared to previous query languages.

#### **Standardization**

- **1986**: The American National Standards Institute (**ANSI**) standardized SQL, making it a universally recognized language for database management.
- **1987**: The International Organization for Standardization (**ISO**) adopted SQL as a standard, further solidifying its position in the industry.
- **Evolution**: SQL has evolved over the years with various versions introducing new features such as support for XML, triggers, and procedural extensions like PL/SQL (Procedural Language/SQL) and T-SQL (Transact-SQL).

#### **Importance of SQL in Database Management**

- **Data Manipulation**: SQL allows efficient querying, updating, and deletion of data.
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Being a standardized language, SQL ensures that data manipulation and retrieval are consistent across different database management systems (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.
- **Scalability**: SQL can handle large datasets, making it suitable for both small applications and large enterprise systems.

### **What is SQL?**

#### **Definition and Purpose**

- **SQL** is a programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows users to define the structure of the data (using **DDL** - Data Definition Language), manipulate the data itself (using **DML** - Data Manipulation Language), control access to the data (using **DCL** - Data Control Language), and manage transactions (using **TCL** - Transaction Control Language).

#### **Overview of Relational Databases**

- **Relational Database**: A collection of data organized into tables (also known as relations). Each table consists of rows (records) and columns (attributes).
- **Relationships**: Tables can be related to each other through **keys** (Primary Key, Foreign Key), enabling complex queries that retrieve data from multiple tables.
- **Normalization**: A process used in relational databases to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by organizing data into related tables.

### **SQL Syntax**

#### **Basic SQL Syntax Rules**

- **Case-Insensitive**: SQL keywords can be written in uppercase or lowercase, but the standard convention is to write them in uppercase for readability.
- **Semicolon (`;`)**: SQL statements usually end with a semicolon, especially in environments where multiple statements are executed sequentially.
- **Comments**:
  - Single-line comments: `-- This is a comment`
  - Multi-line comments: `/* This is a multi-line comment */`

#### **Structure of SQL Statements**

A basic SQL query typically follows this structure:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

- **SELECT**: Specifies the columns of data to retrieve.
- **FROM**: Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.
- **WHERE**: Filters the results based on a specific condition.

**Example**:

```sql
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
WHERE Price > 500;
```

This query retrieves the names and prices of products that cost more than $500 from the `Products` table.

#### **Writing Your First SQL Query**

Let’s write a simple SQL query step by step:

1. **Scenario**: Retrieve the names and cities of customers who are located in the USA from the `Customers` table.

2. **Query**:

   ```sql
   SELECT CustomerName, City
   FROM Customers
   WHERE Country = 'USA';
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - **SELECT CustomerName, City**: Specifies the columns to be retrieved.
   - **FROM Customers**: Indicates the table where the data is stored.
   - **WHERE Country = 'USA'**: Filters the results to include only customers from the USA.

### **Additional Example Tables**

To better understand how SQL works with relational databases, consider the following example tables:

#### **Products Table**

A table that stores information about products.

| **ProductID** | **ProductName** | **SupplierID** | **CategoryID** | **Price** |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| 1             | Laptop          | 1              | 2              | 800       |
| 2             | Smartphone      | 2              | 1              | 600       |
| 3             | Tablet          | 3              | 2              | 300       |

- **Columns**:
  - `ProductID`: Unique identifier for each product.
  - `ProductName`: Name of the product.
  - `SupplierID`: ID of the supplier providing the product.
  - `CategoryID`: ID of the category to which the product belongs.
  - `Price`: Price of the product.

**Sample Query**:

```sql
SELECT ProductName, Price
FROM Products
WHERE CategoryID = 2;
```

This query retrieves the names and prices of products in category 2 (e.g., Electronics).

#### **Orders Table**

A table that stores information about customer orders.

| **OrderID** | **CustomerID** | **OrderDate** | **TotalAmount** |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| 101         | 1              | 2024-08-10    | 1500            |
| 102         | 2              | 2024-08-11    | 2000            |
| 103         | 1              | 2024-08-12    | 500             |

- **Columns**:
  - `OrderID`: Unique identifier for each order.
  - `CustomerID`: ID of the customer who placed the order.
  - `OrderDate`: Date when the order was placed.
  - `TotalAmount`: Total amount for the order.

**Sample Query**:

```sql
SELECT OrderID, TotalAmount
FROM Orders
WHERE CustomerID = 1;
```

This query retrieves the order IDs and total amounts for orders placed by customer 1.

### **Visual Representation of Relationships**

Here’s how these two tables (Products and Orders) could be related in a relational database:

- **Products Table**: Stores product details.
- **Orders Table**: Stores order details and may reference products through a foreign key (though not explicitly shown in this example).

This relationship allows for complex queries that retrieve data from both tables, such as finding all orders that include a specific product.

**Example Query Using JOIN**:

```sql
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Products.ProductName, Orders.TotalAmount
FROM Orders
JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID
WHERE Products.ProductName = 'Laptop';
```

This query retrieves all orders that include the product 'Laptop', showing the order ID, product name, and total amount.
